# Training data sources

Jeff's weights were trained on the sources below. **We release the model weights and code, not the training data.**
Each source keeps its own licence; some are share-alike (CC BY-SA). Licences are shown where our code records them;
for the others, see the source. Every training question is checked against the evaluation sets (the benchmark panel
and JevBench), and near-duplicates are removed.

## Long-list questions (v1.1)

32,250 questions with 20 to 254 options, so the models learn to answer past the 26th option. Built by
[`src/jeff/longlists.py`](../src/jeff/longlists.py):

| Part | Rows | Source | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Made-up lists (destinations, contacts, products, orders, meeting slots, teams, settings) | 20,000 | built in code; all names invented | own |
| MASSIVE intents, all 60 as options | 6,000 | [Amazon MASSIVE 1.1](https://amazon-massive-nlu-dataset.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-massive-dataset-1.1.tar.gz), English training split | CC BY 4.0 |
| CLINC150 intents, all 150 as options (out-of-scope messages answered with "None of these") | 6,250 | [clinc/clinc_oos](https://huggingface.co/datasets/clinc/clinc_oos) "plus" training split, revision 155b9c710419136e17307b80d0a13e68cd46b4ec | CC BY 3.0 |

Only training splits are used; the test splits of MASSIVE and CLINC150 are never trained on. Results on those two data
sets are therefore not zero-shot for v1.1.

## Long documents

Long real documents with human labels, as decision rows: ContractNLI (non-disclosure agreements, CC BY 4.0), ConditionalQA (UK government guidance pages; release under BSD-2, pages under the Open Government Licence) and CUAD (commercial contracts annotated by lawyers for clause types, CC BY 4.0).

## Voice commands

Built in code from Amazon MASSIVE (English voice-assistant commands) and the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, by swapping
words for others that sound the same, to imitate speech-recognition errors.

## Built in code

- 10,000 probability questions (dice, cards, raffles and so on) with exact probabilities as targets.
- Object-tracking and date-arithmetic questions, generated with exact answers.

## Synthetic questions

About 31,000 questions written and checked by an open-weight teacher model (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next) served locally. No
closed-model output is in the training data; a closed model was used only to spot-check the quality of a sample.
